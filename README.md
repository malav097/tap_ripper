# Android surfing game project 

This project started as an angry bird clone, then i rotated the whole game screen 90 degrees to the righ and add some new physics 
and mechanics. It turned itself into what i call a surfing game. You have to keep the momentum bewteent the edges of "the waves".
Need to add some textures and some menus to finish it up. Feel free to fork it!
